The week's price expectations vary significantly, with the most substantial fluctuations concentrated on **Tuesday** and **Sunday**. On **Tuesday**, the average daily price is expected to rise significantly to 10.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, with peak prices potentially exceeding 16 cents. Notably, **Tuesday** carries a high risk of price spikes, which could drive individual hourly prices up to 30-40 cents. The combination of **Tuesday's** high maximum price and low wind power production at certain times explains some of the price variations.

On **Wednesday**, electricity prices are expected to be the lowest of the week, averaging 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, with no significant risk of price spikes. Ample wind power will be available, supporting lower prices.

Approaching the weekend, prices rise, with **Sunday's** average price rising to 8.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. **Sunday** also poses a risk of price spikes, although the maximum price remains below 12 cents. Wind power production is lower at this time, which may affect prices.

Prices for the other days remain relatively stable without major anomalies. **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday** average prices range from 6.6 to 8.4 cents, with no significant risk of price spikes. Average normal wind power production helps stabilize price trends on these days.
