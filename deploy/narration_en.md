Throughout the upcoming week, electricity markets appear relatively variable. **Tuesday** stands out with the highest average price at 9.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Tuesday afternoon and evening, price spikes may occur, especially between 17:00 and 19:00, when wind power production is low. Similarly, on **Thursday**, maximum prices could rise, particularly in the afternoon between 17:00 and 19:00, when wind power is again weaker. These days may surprise consumers with high prices.

**Wednesday**, on the other hand, offers the week's most affordable electricity average price at 3.5 cents. This day is favorable for wind power production, helping to keep prices low throughout the day. **Friday** and **Saturday** appear to be moderate in price, with an average price slightly over 6 cents. No major price fluctuations are expected on these days.

**Sunday** brings a rise in the average price to 8.4 cents. On Sunday, the risk of price spikes is elevated, especially during morning and evening hours when wind power production is at a low level. Meanwhile, next **Monday**, the price level remains relatively high, and the possibility of price spikes exists, particularly in the afternoon.

During the week, the prevailing cold weather, especially on **Tuesday**, may partly explain the higher prices. This suggests that cold weather and low wind power production together can cause significant price spikes on individual days during the week.
