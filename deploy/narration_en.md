In the coming week, electricity prices in Finland will vary significantly across different days. **Tuesday** stands out with the highest average price of 9.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, making it the most expensive day of the week. Price spikes are also predicted for this day, potentially rising to 20-40 cents during specific hours. Wind power production varies significantly, which may partly explain the forecasted price fluctuations.

**Wednesday** is clearly the most affordable day of the week, with an average price of only 3.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. There is plenty of wind power available, keeping prices low. According to forecasts, the risk of price spikes is minimal, offering opportunities for cost-effective electricity usage.

Towards the end of the week, prices remain relatively stable, but on **Sunday**, price spikes are again predicted, although more moderate than on Tuesday. During this time, electricity prices may momentarily reach 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production will be at its lowest on Sunday, which may explain potential price spikes.

**Monday** offers some variation in electricity prices. The average price is 8.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, but there is a risk of price spikes in the forecast. Wind power production remains moderate, and the temperature does not significantly affect the price. Overall, the week looks variable, but Wednesday's affordable prices provide an opportunity for savings in electricity consumption.
